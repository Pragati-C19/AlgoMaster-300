Pseudocode
The key is to track the minimum price so far and calculate profit on each day:

Initialize min_price to a large number (e.g., infinity) and max_profit to 0.
Loop through each price:
If the current price is less than min_price, update min_price.
Otherwise, calculate the profit (price - min_price) and update max_profit if itâ€™s larger.
Return max_profit.
