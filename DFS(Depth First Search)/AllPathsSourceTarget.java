/*
 * 
 * Intuitions :
 * 
 * 1. We have given Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of n nodes
 * 2. Find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1
 * 3. return them in any order
 * 4. graph array looks like : 
 *      graph[i] is list of all nodes you can visit from node i
 *      graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
 *      - from node 0 we can visit node [1, 2]
 *      - from node 1 we can visit node [3]
 *      - from node 2 we can visit node [3]
 *      - from node 3 we can't visit any node as the list is empty
 * 
 * 
 * Pattern :
