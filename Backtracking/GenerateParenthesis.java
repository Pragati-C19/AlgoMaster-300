/*
 * 
 * Intuitions :
 * 
 * 1. The problem is asking us to generate all possible combinations of
 * well-formed parentheses.
 * 2. We can use a backtracking approach to solve this problem.
 * 3. We have given n and remeber that we have n numbers of open brackets and n
 * numbers of close brackets
 * 4. At start it's compulsory to add open bracket
 * 5. At the end it's compulsory to add close bracket
 * 6. We can add up to n open brackets but when it's time for clossing bracket
 * check if their count is less than open ones
 * - open < n - add " ( " bracket open++
 * - open > close - add " ) " bracket close++
 * - open == close == n - return the array
 * 7. will use recursion
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Pattern :
 * 
 * 1. Backtracking = Brute Force + Pruning
 * 2. Identify problems where choices lead to valid solutions.
 * 3. Follow the pattern:
 * - Make a choice ‚úÖ
 * - Recurse üîÑ
 * - Undo the choice (backtrack) ‚ùå
 * 4. Always use base cases to stop unnecessary recursion.
 * 
 * Pseudo Code:
 * 
 * function generateParenthesis(int n){
 * 
 *      result  = new Array
 *      
 *      backtracking(result, 0, 0, "", n);
 *      
 *      return result;
 * }
 * 
 * function backtracking(int[] result, int openCount, int CloseCount, String current, int n){
 *      
 *      // open == close == n
 *      if(current.length == n * 2){
 *          result.add(current)
 *          return;
 *      }
 *      else if(open < n){
 *          backtracking(result, openCount + 1, closeCount, current + "(", n);
 *      }
 *      else if(close < open){
 *          backtracking(result, openCount, closeCount + 1, current + ")", n);
 *      }
 *      
 * } 
 *
