/*
 * Intuitions :
 
    1. We have given an integer array nums and a target
    2. we want to build an expression out of nums
        - by adding one of the symbols '+' or '-' before each integer in nums
        - and then concatenate all integers
    3. example :
        nums = [2, 1]
        we can add '+' before 2 and '-' before 1 
        and concatenate them to build the expression '+2-1'
    4. return the number of diff expressions that can be build 
        where after solving that expression will get target

 
 * Pattern :
 
    1. Get total sum first 
        add all num in nums array and add it 
    2.  
    2. will set a subStringSum 
            which is 
 
 
 * Pseudo Code :
