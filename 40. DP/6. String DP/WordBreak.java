/*
 * Intuitions :
 
    1. we have given a string(s) and a dictornary of strings(wordDict)
    2. return true if s can be segmented into a space-seperated sequence of one or more dictionary words
        what does it means?
            example : s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
                Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
    3. we can use same word in dictionary multiple times
 
 * Pattern :
